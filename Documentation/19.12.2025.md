I followed the tutorial until 1h10 min

Routing was implemented then
The background, logo. search bar was implemented

The tutorial showed about interfaces in typescript, use of router and explain that everything that used "use..." to be delclared are called hooks
Exemple : useRouter, useLocalSearchParams, useNavigation
