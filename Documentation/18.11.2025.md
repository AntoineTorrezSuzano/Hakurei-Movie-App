While following the tutorial, the snippet "rnfes" was used in the video but not working for me
I asked gemini for the "rnfes" snippet "reactNativeFunctionalExportComponentWIthStyles" and it answered :
```
Modern React Snippets" (by Anurag Kanwar or Grio).
```
This is the name for the plugin to install. It worked and I got the willing snippet.

And this is a link tag :
```kotlin 
<Link
    href={{
        pathname: '/movie/[id]',
        params: { id: 'Touhou' }
    }}>
    Movies
</Link>
```
And this is how to use it : 
```kotlin
import {StyleSheet, Text, View} from 'react-native'
import React from 'react'
import {useLocalSearchParams} from "expo-router";

const Details = () => {
    const { id } = useLocalSearchParams();
    return (
        <View>
            <Text>Movie details: {id}</Text>
        </View>
    )
}
    export default Details
        const styles = StyleSheet.create({})

```
